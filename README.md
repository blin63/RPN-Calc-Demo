# RPN Calc Demo

**NOTE: This is a small demo program written for a past school assignment
while learning how to code in C++**

This is a basic RPN calculator that accepts user input
in the console. Simply enter the calculation formula you would
like to compute in RPN syntax when prompted and the program will
return the result from the formula given.
